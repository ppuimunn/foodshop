# foodshop

Hi! This was created for an NTU module called IM2073 Introduction to Design & Project where we are supposed to create a website selling anything. 
Hence I decided to sell virtual food from one of my favourite games: Genshin Impact!

This website uses MySQL to run the database and Apache Tomcat for the server.

Key features of the website are the add-to-cart function (coded on frontend) and the query function. Both of which sends details to the database.

What's missing from the code is the SQL codes for the database for orders and queries.
